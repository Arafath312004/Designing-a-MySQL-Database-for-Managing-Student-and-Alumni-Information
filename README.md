# Designing-a-MySQL-Database-for-Managing-Student-and-Alumni-Information

This project focuses on creating and implementing a relational database system to streamline job tracking for current students and alumni. The database, built on the MySQL platform, addresses the need for centralized access to job-related information. By following fundamental relational database design principles and applying normalization techniques, the system ensures data integrity and optimized performance. Advanced functionalities such as triggers and stored procedures are integrated to enhance efficiency and maintain consistency. The overarching goal of this project is to strengthen communication between employers and candidates, promoting professional development and engagement in line with the university's mission.
